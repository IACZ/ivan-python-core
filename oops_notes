Object oriented programming
- Mirror real world into software world

1. Real world actor -> data in the memory
  - students, professors, librarian, book, author,....
  - object
  - str, int, float, bool -> objects
  - class : objects are created from a class. 1 to n objects.
  a class gives a data type to an object
  - str, int, float, bool,..... -> built in classes
2. Real world actor characteristics -> Object attributes
  - Every object can have its own set of attributes
  - all the attributes are grouped in the object
3. Real world actor actions -> method calls on the object
